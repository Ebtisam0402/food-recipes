Fish Tacos
==========

* 2 medium tomatoes, seeded and finely chopped
* 1 small red onion, peeled and finely chopped
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro
* 1 jalapeno, seeded and finely chopped (optional)
* 1/4 cup mayonnaise
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 1 lime, one half cut into wedges
* kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tsp hot sauce
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1.5 tsps chili powder
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1/4 cup peanut oil
* pat of butter
* 1 lb flounder or other white fish, cut across the grain into 0.5-inch by 3-inch long strips
* 12 six-inch corn tortillas
* 2 cups shredded green cabbage

## Preparing the salsa

Combine the tomatoes, onion, garlic, cilantro, and jalapeno in a medium bowl. Set aside.

## Preparing the crema

In a small bowl, whisk the mayonnaise, sour cream, and hot sauce until combined. Season to taste with juice from the half lime, salt, and pepper.

## Preparing the fish

In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, chili powder, and 1.5 tsp each of kosher salt and black pepper. Place the fish in another medium bowl and pour the milk on top of the fish.

## Frying the fish

Pour 0.25 cup of the peanut oil into a 12-inch frying pan or skillet over medium-high heat until it reaches 425-450F. Add the butter to the pan.

In batches, remove the fish pieces from the milk bath and dredge them lightly through the flour mixture, shaking to remove excess. Place the fish in the oil, without crowding them, and cook until deep golden brown on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn carefully and cook for 1 minute more. Remove to a warmed, paper-towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt. Repeat with the remaining fish.

## Preparing the tortillas

Lightly grease a skillet with a drizzle of oil over medium heat. Heat the tortillas, one or two at a time, until they are soft and hot. Keep them warm on a plate, under a dish towel.

## Assembly

Fill each tortilla with 2-3 pieces of fish, followed by tomato salsa, a dollop of crema, and a pinch of cabbage. Serve 2 to 3 tacos per person, with lime wedges and hot sauce on the side.

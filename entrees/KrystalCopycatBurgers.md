Copycat Krystal Cheeseburgers
=============================

* 12 – 14 Dinner Rolls (Parker house shape, 2 1/2″ x 2 1/2″ size)
* 1 lb. lean ground beef (80% lean)
* 1/2 C. water (for beef)
* 1/2 tsp. Salt
* 3/4 C. diced onions
* 1 beef bouillon cube
* 1/2 – 1 C. Water (for onions)
* Dill Hamburger Slices

In food processor place ground beef, salt and water. Process for a few seconds so water and salt are blended through ground beef and meat should look a little pasty. On a 11″ x 13″ jelly roll pan place plastic wrap on bottom. Place hamburger in middle and with another piece of plastic wrap on top of meat. Roll hamburger out to 1/4″ thick. Remove plastic wrap and cut meat into 3″ x 3″squares, leave ground beef pieces on tray. You should get between 12 and 14 squares. Perforate each piece five times with the end of a plastic straw, this will give the meat little steam holes. Cover hamburger with plastic wrap and place in freezer until meat is partially frozen but not solid.

Place onions, beef bouillon, and 1/2 cup water in fry pan. On medium low heat saute and stir onions until they are clear, more water may be added as needed. Turn heat off until ready to cook hamburger patties.

When beef patties are ready to prepare, turn fry pan on medium low heat and add enough water to onions just so the bottom of fry pan is covered. Place patties in pan and cover with lid.

Frying time is just a few moments. Turn patties and cook until done but not dry. The patties should be juicy. When hamburgers are finished cooking place on top of a roll add pickles, cover hamburgers so they will steam slightly or pop in microwave covered just for a few seconds until ready to serve.

Also: add cheese, mustard & ketchup

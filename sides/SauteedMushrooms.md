# Easy Sauteed Mushrooms

These are the easiest (and damn near best-tasting) mushrooms you'll ever eat. The mushrooms and sauce are fantastic for spreading on steak or just eating right out of a bowl. Takes about 5 minutes to prep, 15 minutes to cook, and seconds to devour. The recipe calls for 1 package of button mushrooms. However, they shrink a lot during cooking so you might want to double your serving.


## Ingredients

* 1 package of button mushrooms
* 3 tbsp butter
* 2 tsp garlic salt

## Directions

Wash and slice the mushrooms into 1/8" slices. Turn your burner on to medium heat and begin melting the butter in a nonstick pan. When the butter is melted, sprinkle 1 tsp of garlic salt in the pan and toss in the mushrooms. Stir to coat. Allow mushrooms to simmer uncovered for 5-10 minutes. As they begin to absorb the juices, sprinkle with the rest of the garlic salt. Simmer for another 5 minutes or until desired tenderness. Serve immediately.

A great salsa recipe for dipping your nachos or veggies. Made quick, and packs a great flavour.

## Ingredients

* A can of diced tomatoes or about 3 large tomatoes
* A clove of garlic
* Half an onion
* A few cilantro leaves
* A jalapeño
* Half of a lime

## Directions

Remove a little bit of tomato juice from the can that is on top. This will help make your salsa dip more solid. If you opted for regular tomatoes, make sure they are firm and fleshy. Slice up the tomatoes in to small dices.

Slice the onion in small pieces. Slice your garlic into really small pieces. From the jalapeño remove the seeds, and slice in similar size to your onion.
In a small bowl mix your ingredients together, squeeze half of your lime for juice. Mix again.

Now scoop your salsa into a presentation bowl and add the cilantro for decoration on top.

Krispy Chocolate Cookies
===================

Contributed by [@andy5995](https://github.com/andy5995).

* 1/3 cup cocoa
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1 1/2 cup rice krispies (brand name or generic)
* 1/2 cup butter
* 2 cups miniature marshmallows
* 1 cup peanut butter chips (or regular peanut butter)

In a small bowl, combine cocoa and sugar. Over a low to medium heat, begin melting the butter. Stir and be sure not to scorch the butter. After it's about half-way melted, add peanut butter chips. Stir frequently. After they are about half-way melted, add marshmallows. Stir frequently. After it's all melted, add the cocoa and sugar. Stir mixture until smooth. Add rice krispies and stir them into the mixture.

Turn off the heat and wait two minutes. Pour onto a cookie sheet (you may also place parchment paper onto the cookie sheet and pour mixture directly onto that for easier clean-up).

After the mixture has cooled to room temperature, cut into smaller pieces with the end of a plastic flipper (a.k.a. pancake turner).

## Recipe variations:

* add 1/4 cup of raisins
* substitute the 1 1/2 cups of rice krispies for 1 1/4 cups of quick cooking oats

Apple Dutch Baby
================

* 1 honeycrisp apple (or similar)
* 3 eggs
* ½ cup flour
* ½ cup milk
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* Pinch of nutmeg
* Pinch of cinnamon
* 4 tablespoons butter
* Syrup, preserves, confectioners' sugar or cinnamon sugar

Allow the eggs, milk, and butter time to reach room temperature. This helps the pancake rise.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Peel and slice apple into thin sections approx 1" square.

Combine eggs, flour, milk, sugar and nutmeg in a blender jar and blend until smooth. Batter may also be mixed by hand.

Place butter in a heavy 10-inch skillet or baking dish and place in the oven. Add apple slices and sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon.

As soon as the butter has melted (watch it so it does not burn) and the apple has started to turn golden, add the batter to the pan, return pan to the oven and bake for 20 minutes, until the pancake is puffed and golden. Lower oven temperature to 300 degrees and bake five minutes longer.

Remove pancake from oven, cut into wedges and serve at once topped with syrup, preserves, confectioners' sugar or cinnamon sugar.
